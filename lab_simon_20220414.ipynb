Create a query or queries to extract the information you think may be relevant for building the prediction model. \n","#   It should include some film features and some rental features. Use the data from 2005.\n","# 2. Create a query to get the list of films and a boolean indicating if it was rented last month (May 2005). This would be our target variable.\n","# 3. Read the data into a Pandas dataframe.\n","# 4. Analyze extracted features and transform them. You may need to encode some categorical variables, or scale numerical variables.\n","# 5. Create a logistic regression model to predict this variable from the cleaned data.\n","# 6.
